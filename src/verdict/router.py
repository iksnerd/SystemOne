"""Route a prompt to a big model or a small one. A `Switch` (see `switch.py`) with two cases.

The bank is `laya.router_questions()`, upstream's own, not one invented here. FINDINGS §14: its
`difficulty` question scores AUC 0.90 to 0.92 against 0.81 for the best question this project made
up, in one question rather than two, and it scores as well on the base checkpoint as on the
fine-tuned one. That is the §2 pattern: a question inside Laya's training mix runs near ceiling and
an invented one does not.

Only two of upstream's four are used. `domain` is an exclusive choice, which §3 and §9 show
collapses onto a majority class, and `needs_tools` measured *below* chance on our prompts (AUC 0.41
and 0.34): it asks about the request rather than about which model should serve it.

So this is the worked example of the point `switch.py` makes. The interface is two cases and a
default. The mechanism underneath is not the obvious exclusive choice over {"small", "big"} but a
calibrated cut on a `score` question, because that is what measured better.

The definitions are copied here rather than imported so that importing this module, and the whole
test suite, needs neither `laya` nor torch. `tests/test_router.py::test_bank_matches_upstream`
asserts the copy still matches `laya.router_questions()` whenever `laya` is installed, so it cannot
drift silently.
