"""Scoring functions the scorers share.

Each of these existed in `scripts/` in at least two copies with slightly different details: two
bootstrap routines with different iteration counts and percentile arithmetic (`eval_real.ci` at
1000 iterations indexing [25] and [974], `eval_router.bootstrap_ci` at 4000 indexing by fraction),
and a total-variation distance that only one scorer had. Different numbers from the same intent is
the failure mode worth removing; the interval is now one implementation with the sample count
visible at the call site.
