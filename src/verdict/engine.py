"""Loading a model, and asking it things, in one place.

`Backend` (see `backend.py`) is the seam the HTTP API talks through: one `DecideRequest` in, one
`DecideResponse` out. That is the right shape for serving and the wrong shape for scoring 360
states in a loop.

So there are two seams, on purpose, and this is the batch one. `MlxBackend` is a thin
translation layer over an `Engine`, and anything doing bulk work uses the `Engine` directly and
keeps raw dicts instead of paying for pydantic on every question.

The tokenizer loads lazily, because it is only needed for `clip` and a caller that already has
short states should not pay for it.
