"""A switch statement whose branch is chosen by a model instead of by `==`.

This is the shape every problem here takes. You do not ask a model to think about your prompt;
you declare the branches you are willing to take, name the one to fall back to, and get one of
them back with numbers attached:

    BIG_SMALL = Switch(
        name="big-vs-small",
        cases={"small": "a lookup, a definition, a one-liner",
               "big":   "multi-step reasoning, code changes, anything with consequences"},
        default="big",
        questions=...,
        select=...,
    )

Three things the declaration buys, all of which a free-text answer has to re-earn every call:

- **The branches are closed.** The return value is a key of `cases`, checked. There is no parsing
  step and therefore no parse failure.
- **`default` is mandatory**, and it is the branch taken when the model is unsure or absent. Most
  routing problems have asymmetric cost, so the safe branch should be written down once, in the
  declaration, rather than recovered at each call site.
- **The mechanism is separate from the interface.** `select` decides *how* the branch is chosen.

That last point is the whole reason this is not one function. The obvious implementation of a
switch is one exclusive `choice` question listing the cases, and on this project's data that is
the *worst* available mechanism: §3 and §9 measured it collapsing onto a majority class (one
branch taken for 59% of inputs where the true share was a sixth) and shifting several points when
the options were merely reordered. `choice_switch` below builds that, because sometimes it is what
you want and it takes one line, but `Switch` does not assume it. The big-vs-small router in
`router.py` is the same interface compiled to a calibrated threshold on a `score` question, which
measured far better (§14, AUC 0.92 against 0.81).

So: declare the problem as a switch, then measure which mechanism serves it, and change the
mechanism without touching the call sites.
