"""The repository is public; the author's machine and private work are not.

An audit on 2026-09-26 found home paths, private repo and skill names, the author's own prompts
quoted from agent transcripts, private room contents, and a sentence about a person's birth data
in tracked files. Nothing secret, but none of it belongs in a public project. This keeps it out:
every text file that ships is scanned for the markers of that material. `CLAUDE.local.md` is
gitignored and is where machine-specific agent notes belong.
